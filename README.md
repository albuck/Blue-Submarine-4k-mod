# Blue-Submarine-4k-mod
Gtk theme modification for 28 inch 4k monitor.

Mate desktop GTK theme with ~1.5 larger widgets and spaces between them for 28 inch 4k resolution (DPI/PPI=157) monitor. It will probably work for other monitors with a similar resolution (DPI/PPI).

Theme works... Also, there are still things to fix and improve.

## Some tips for theme user

- increase the Mate panel size (for example to 42 pixels).
- set the correct DPI for the fonts according to the PPI of the monitor.
- increase size of icons in apps menu (use Mate Tweak).
- icon themes that have colored toolbar icons are better suited for this theme.
- increase the size of the Firefox scrollbar.
- for QT applications, put in "/etc/environment":
   QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
   QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0
